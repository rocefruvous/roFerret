don't use it pwease it kinda sucks
i made it only to kinda learn js and try out making extensions (i kinda fucked up the manifest too)

## features
- custom sidebar with fancy icons and robux count wow so crazy and original i know i know thanks
- home greeting (i fucked up the time and too lazy to fix it)
- rep counter it kinda works and at time doesn't also there's no number decorations sorru
